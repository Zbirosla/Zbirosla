# 👋 Hi, I'm Slávek Zbirovský

Welcome to my GitHub profile — I’m a researcher and PhD student passionate about automating the conversion of reality capture data into Building Information Models (BIM).

## 🔍 Current Focus

- Developing pipelines for the **automatic conversion of point clouds into IFC-based BIM models**
- Creating **synthetic datasets** of building point clouds to support machine learning tasks
- Exploring the use of **IfcOpenShell**, **YOLO-based detection**, and other **AI tools** in the Scan-to-BIM process

## 🧠 Learning & Interests

- **IfcOpenShell** for IFC model manipulation  
- **Point cloud processing** and 3D geometry  
- **Machine learning** techniques for object detection and classification in construction  
- **Computer vision** approaches for architectural element recognition
